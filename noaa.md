## Aviation Weather

Note also https://aviationweather.gov/adds/dataserver and especially https://aviationweather.gov/dataserver/adds/current https://aviationweather.gov/dataserver/current for 5 minute METAR data

See https://www.aviationweather.gov/metar for METARS map and https://www.aviationweather.gov/docs/metar/stations.txt for station data.

Also found http://weather.rap.ucar.edu/surface/stations.txt but not clear what is authoritative.
