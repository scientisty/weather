note differences between QPF and PQPF
QPF - in inches?
PQPF - based off 6-hour QPFs and ensembles of model forecasts, two forms, both (and QPF) deal with (filled) contours!
 "Probability of Precipitation of at Least a Specific Amount"
 maps shows probability that precipitation will meet or exceed a threshold amount
"Precipitation Amount by Percentile"
 maps shows precipitation accumulataion that is not expected to be exceeded by the percentile amount, 50% is the default view and easiest to parse, but say 5th percentile means that thre is a 95% chance that accumulation will meet or exceed the depicted amount, it's like the chance that you're wrong, what's not clear is precisely how the inch contour lines are calculated. 
 note that precip by percentile at 50% is visually similar to the QPF map
 see http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/pqpf/about_pqpf_products.shtml for details
 deal with uncertanty about the WPC QPF
